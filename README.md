# Analysing Crypto Portfolios

The main porpouse of this project is to analyse my current crypto portfolio with different configurations and with return of a single coin. For this, I used mainly investpy and a little pandas. 

In further analysis, I plan to do differents backtesting with some of the portfolios that I analysed in this project.

In case of any question, feel free to contact me. :)
